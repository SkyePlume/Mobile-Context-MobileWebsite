				<p>Mobile devices have become device of choice, of the majority of people in the world to access the online world.
					With the release of the first generation of IPhone back in 2007, the outlook on technology has switched focus from a desktop and laptop perspective to a mobile perspective, via Smartphones and tablets.
					In today’s world the smartphone/Tablet can do almost everything that a PC can do, all from the palm of your hand.
					In 2013 there was an estimated 1.43 billion smartphone users in the world, with such a large proportion of the world’s population owning one of these devices it has become clear mobile devices are here to stay.

				<p>With the majority of the world in possession of these devices, it was predictable that they would begin to progress and start to gain an even larger influence over our personal lives.
					With almost 1.5 billion smartphone owners in just 2013, it is safe guess to assume a large proportion of those users are still in mandatory education. 
					Although there are currently relaxed views of students using their mobile devices during school time, there is a current stigma that the students are using their smart devices to waste time and distract them away from their school work.
					For example, Ritchel (THE GAME CHANGER: USING IPADS IN COLLEGE TEACHER EDUCATION CLASSES, 2010): “Many educators and parents are afraid that these devices are causing a "digital distraction" which is leading to a generation of children who have trouble focusing on tasks”.
				</p>
				<p>Whilst others suggest that it’s not actually the student’s faults, it’s the teachers and lecturers who aren’t able to adjust to today’s technology to involve them in their teaching.
					For example; Tapscott (THE GAME CHANGER: USING IPADS IN COLLEGE TEACHER EDUCATION CLASSES, 2008): “Sadly, these old-style educators - locked into models that go back centuries - end up heaping abuse on the students who are revolutionizing the model of pedagogy”.
					Due to the resistance of teachers it is likely that full incorporation of mobile devices into everyday teaching won’t actually occur until there are measures to prevent these problems.

				<p>Although there is a large portion of the teaching profession who are all for the implementation of mobile technology becoming a part of the classroom.
					Studies have been attempted to analyse the benefits to the education of students at all age ranges.
					As early as 2009 there were reports that young children were becoming engrossed in using mobile technology.
					For example, Lieberman et al., (Using Mobile Devices for Teaching Realistic Mathematics in Kindergarten Education. 2009a) commented that: “Young children age three to six years old play with a vast variety of digital learning activities, now available on desktop monitors and portable screens, spending a constantly increasing amount of time doing so.”
				</p>
				<p>Now that there are positive signs of encouragement that so many children are using mobile technology outside of school to improve their learning.
					Some schools in the United States have attempted to introduce I-pod touch devices into kindergarten classes, after the children became accustomed to the devices, improvement amongst students was recorded.
					For example, a study by Chiong and Shuler (2010) in the United States “Involving iPod touch devices and audio-visual material properly configured for children ages three to seven years old showed that children drew remarkable gains in vocabulary and phonological awareness”.
					Due to the success of the previous experiment further studies were done on Kindergarten classes across the US which also provided positive results.
					For example, Bebell, Dorris and Muir (Using Mobile Devices for Teaching Realistic Mathematics in Kindergarten Education, 2012):
					On kindergarten students selected randomly to use tablets for the study of literacy, showed that infants who used tablets recorded remarkably strong performance in their phonological awareness and their ability to represent sounds with letters in relation to other children that did not.

				<p>The benefits of mobile devices in the classroom were a huge hit amongst students between the ages of 3 and 7. So it was worth taking a look at the kind of impact smart devices would have at a higher level of education. 
					The next step was to look at the effect they would have at older students studying at primary and secondary school level. Would this increase in level of education reduce the effect mobile devices have on results, or would the older generation of students become distracted?
					A huge task for teachers at the moment is getting students to interact with the sessions and focus on their studies, so why should mobile devices be viewed as a distraction instead of an aid.
					For example, Savilla Banister (Integrating the iPod Touch in K–12 Education: Visions and Vices Computers in the Schools, 2010): “The iPod Touch (and the iPhone) is equipped to perform a multitude of complex tasks, many of which can be commandeered to accomplish a myriad of educational objectives”.
				</p>
				<p>Current classes today include some form on technological interaction whether it’s through PC’s or Laptops, the schools often provide these outlets for the students to work on, often these machines take up full rooms and can cost a lot of money to maintain.
					Mobile devices don’t suffer from this, for example, Savilla Banister (Integrating the iPod Touch in K–12 Education: Visions and Vices Computers in the Schools, 2010): “These devices are inexpensive, compared to classroom laptop carts or computer labs, and their portability and durability provide students with potential learning tools that traverse the classroom, bus stop, and home”.
					Teachers will have a much harder task to keep the attention of teenagers than infants, also the pure amount of students in public school classes make it almost impossible for the teachers to track the use of all mobile devices in the class.
					Also if the devices are provided by the school, the teachers have to make sure the software is up to date and the devices are fully charged before each sessions, the teachers then have to have adequate knowledge of the devices for it to be worth using.

				<p>The last jump in level of education is to use mobile devices at college and university level.
					As college education isn’t a mandatory level of education the outlook of mobile devices is far more relaxed then it is at pre, primary and secondary school levels.
					There usually aren’t college policies that prevent students from utilising mobile devices during their studies, and due to the portability and relatively low cost of tablets and smart phones student will use these to take notes and interact with lecturers rather than the classic pen and paper of old.
					There is also the case of lecturers actually being the ones to incorporate mobile devices into their teachings.
					It has become very common for lecturers to have a copy of their slides or notes on a tablet when they are giving the lectures, it also allows the lectures the freedom to upload and share resources they have with their students online then it is to print out physical copies.
				</p>
				<p>Studies have already started in America, for example Foote (THE GAME CHANGER: USING IPADS IN COLLEGE TEACHER EDUCATION CLASSES, 2010):
					Described a pilot project at Westlake High School in Austin, Texas that investigated whether iPads were helpful in a school and/or library environment.
					The pilot project was comprised of three ongoing projects, namely the use of the iPad for teachers, the library applications of the iPad for library student focus groups and small-group classroom assignments using the iPad.
					It relates that teachers have found the iPad as a useful tool for working with students with special needs.
				</p>
				<p>The results concluded that using IPad’s benefited both teacher and student, in both convenience and cost efficient ways, for example Foote (THE GAME CHANGER: USING IPADS IN COLLEGE TEACHER EDUCATION CLASSES, 2010):
					Students were so happy to be able to download their textbook to their iPad. 
					It was cheaper for them and that really made them less angry at me for making them buy so many books. 
					I was also easily able to upload other readings in PDF for them to read without having to use the printer. 
					When I had discussions about book material, students used the iBook to find quotes to support their ideas. I never saw that with a regular textbook.

				<p>After analysing the impact mobile devices have had at different levels of education is has become very clear that the introduction of smart devices have had a good effect on the education of their students, when teachers have been able to prevent students from becoming distracted by the touch devices.
					The responsibility is strongly placed on the teachers and the idea that all students are wasting time when on the devices needs to be dropped, for example GEIST, E., (2011):
					It is important to note that faculty involvement and acceptance of these devices was found to be especially important to the effective use of these devices. 
					The next generation of students will be vastly different from any before due to mobile devices and the ubiquitous availability of information and data.
					Pedagogy will need to evolve to meet the needs of these students.
				</p>
				<p>With no sign of smart devices disappearing from mainstream society, it will be very hard for education systems not to involve mobile devices in the curriculum.
					As times change technology evolves with it, the typical ICT lessons of today will soon adapt from desktop pcs and laptops to tablet devices in the near future.
					The popularity of “app” based programs, soon students will have access to vast amounts of resources and school work at the tap of a button, at any place and at any time, without be tied down to desktop computer.
					No matter at what level of education they may be studying at.
